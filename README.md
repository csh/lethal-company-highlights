# Lethal Company Highlights

Uses Steam's new Game Recording feature to capture your best deaths in service to the Company.

## Requirements

You must enable Game Recording in Steam's Settings as they don't provide a way for the mod to enable it.

Configure quality settings to your heart's desire, and don't forget to enable the **Record Microphone** option so everyone can laugh at you screaming later on!
